## Our Core Beliefs

- **Humans Still Matter**: Even as AI lowers barriers and automates tasks, it’s the *operator*—the individual or lean team—who orchestrates AI agents, tools, and platforms.
- **Lean Teams, Massive Impact**: With the right AI strategies, smaller operations can compete head-on with large incumbents—sometimes outperforming them.
- **Continuous Learning and Sharing**: As AI tools evolve at a rapid pace, we believe in openly sharing strategies, workflows, and real-world lessons.
